# Comparison of Gas and Charging Costs

This is a simple calculator to evaluate and compare the cost of refueling a gas car against charging an electric vehicle under pretty reasonable assumptions. Multiple options, corresponding to several available rates, are included for the electric vehicle.

All aspects of the calculation are parametrizable. The best way to see all the possibilities is to run the app:

    streamlit run carsim.py

The only dependencies are streamlit for the UI, numpy for the calculations and matplotlib for the charts.
